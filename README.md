### Hi there 👋

I'm an computer man who computers for a living 🐧, originally from London (later Dorset) currently based in Crewe.

My interests include: Linux, Python, Go, Raspberry Pi, Pine64, ANT+ and Web Technologies. My Goal is to build a health monitoring application that respects your data and can be self-hosted. Achieving this is still a long way off but I'm enjoying the process of learning.
